STEPS:
1. Execute "git clone https://github.com/zacho0328/MasterChef.git" to retrieve the repository.
2. Once in the MasterChef directory execute ".\MasterChef.html".
3. This will open a browser page with a search box that will take the input food item or keyword
such as "chicken" or "chicken beef". 
4. After typing the word out you MUST click the search box to search and not use the "Enter" key.

FEATURES:
1. v1.0 consists of a search box which allows for the input of a keyword(s) and in return will 
return back the top recipe for those words along with the link to the recipe site and the 
amount of cook time (estimate).
2. v2.0 I would like to have it consist of being able to print out the top three recieps for a 
given search in a neat format instead of just one. I would like to make the entire page much more
visually appealing and am thinking of how. Lastly I would like to have either a nutriton and or 
ingredient section for each meal.
3. v3.0 What I would like to have implemented but will not be able to at the time are a pricing
diagram, an allergy filter for nuts, fish, dairy, etc., a meal planner taking into account calorie
and meal goals for set periods of time.
